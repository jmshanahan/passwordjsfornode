# Authentication using Passportjs

## Introduction
The core of this project was taken from the second part of a course Learn NodeJS Authentication with Udemy.

This application uses the dotenv to set environment variables. 
You will need to add a .env with your username and password.
DBUSER=myusername

DBPASSWORD=mypassword

The username and password get used in the config/database.js file.
Can now commit this file as it no longer stores the actual username and password as these are stored as environment variables.
